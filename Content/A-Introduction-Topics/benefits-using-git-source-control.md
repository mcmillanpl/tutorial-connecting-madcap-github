        <h1>Benefits of using GitHub as source control</h1>
        <p>While Flare users can choose to store their projects directly on their local PC, this has some risks and limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Projects saved to a local PC is at risk to hard disk failures/loss of data which could result in users needing to recreate it from scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Storing locally prevents multiple authors to work together on the same project easily.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Flare supports most major version control systems, including Subversion (SVN), Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS), Git, and others. This documentation focuses on GitHub.</p>
        <p>Using GitHub (or another source control system) stores the main copy of the project on a server, which eliminates the risk and also allows for streamlined collaboration.</p>
        <h2>&#160;</h2>
        <h2>Mitigating risk</h2>
        <p>Housing the source project on GitHub means that if an author's hard drive crashes, only their changes are lost rather than the entire project.</p>
        <h2>&#160;</h2>
        <h2>Increasing collaboration</h2>
        <p>Authors can download copies of the main project, make changes, then commit their versions back to the main project. GitHub tracks these changes and can warn of any conflicts. GitHub also offers other benefits, such as the ability to "roll back" to an earlier version or to highlight differences between two version of the same file.</p>
